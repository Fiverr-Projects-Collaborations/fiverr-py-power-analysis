README file including short descriptions of all files and dependencies, and information on how to run the programs.

Your code should include comments to explain what the developed code for each investigation does and how. It is useful to keep track of your changes in the comments at the top of the program, or use a version control system (e.g. git â€“ but make sure your code is not viewable publicly!). Feel free to re-use the code and approaches from the lectures and practicals. However, remember to self-cite and cite your sources. If you submit work that you have already submitted for a previous assessment (in this unit or any other) you have to specifically state this.
Beyond the working program, you will submit two documents: User Documentation for your code and a Power Investigation Report on your experiments. There will be bonus marks for additional functionality and the use of more advanced programming techniques (e.g. interactivity, high quality visualisation, 3D space, parameter sweep etc.) but only if they're sensible and done well. Make sure to discuss the additional work in your User Documentation and Report, this will be easier if you make notes and keep old (incremental) versions of your code as you work.
